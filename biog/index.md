# Biog

Gareth Gwynn is a writer, presenter and radio producer, currently based in London.

Gareth started his career at Bath University's student radio station, 1449AM URB, 
where he won the Gold award for Best Comedy Show at the National Student Radio 
Awards (hosted by BBC Radio 1). On leaving University, Gareth became a presenter at 
the commercial radio station 106.3 Bridge FM.

In 2007, Gareth secured a pilot on BBC Radio 7 which led to him joining the writing 
team for BBC Radio 4's "Listen Against" and contributing to the BBC Radio 7 sketch 
show "Play and Record". He was also part of the initial presenting line-up of 107.9 
Afan FM. It was during this time that Gareth won the 4Talent award for Radio 
Presentation, in a scheme supported by Channel 4 and judged by Channel 4 Radio.

In November 2007, Gareth joined the newly launched "XFM South Wales" as producer 
of "The Roop and Tom Breakfast Show". Following the station's closure, Gareth became 
a producer for BBC Radio Wales working with Rhod Gilbert on both his Saturday morning 
show and the second series of the panel game "Jest A Minute". During this time Gareth 
continued to write for the BBC Radio Comedy department on "Tilt", "Listen Against" 
and "The News Quiz" as well as reuniting with Roop and Tom on "B.A.D. Radio", a sketch 
show for GWR Bath.

In 2009, Gareth was appointed as contract writer for the BBC Radio Comedy department. As 
a recipient of the department's annual writer's bursary, Gareth worked across a wide 
range of BBC Radio Comedy programming, including "The Now Show" and "The News Quiz" 
(writing for the show throughout 2009, the year in which it was nominated for a Sony 
Radio Award).

On completing the bursary, Gareth joined the main writing team for Radio 4's flagship 
comedy show for the 2010 general election, "The Vote Now Show". He also worked as script 
editor and Producer for Tidy Productions on the BBC Radio Wales panel game "What's 
The Story?" and acted as script editor on the open-door sketch show "Newsjack" for 
BBC Radio 7.

The second half of 2010 will see Gareth continue to write for both "The News Quiz" 
and "The Now Show" as well as "The Jason Byrne Show" for BBC Radio 2 and "The Armstrong 
And Miller Show" for BBC One. In August "Antiquity", a sitcom pilot written by Gareth 
and John-Luke Roberts and starring Tim McInnerny, Nadia Kamil, Will Andrews and 
Andrew Sachs, will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4.
