# Podcasts & Videos

On this page, you'll find links to some of the radio shows, podcasts and videos I've appeared in or worked on. I'll use the blog on the front page to flag up anything new, but these are links to bits and bobs that won't expire after only 30 days. Apologies in advance for any broken links - The internet is built on shifting sands.

## Little Book Documentaries - BBC Radio 4

I have presented two documentaries for BBC Radio 4 examining Welsh identity, language, culture and politics. The first, "[Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Independence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b055g69f)" was broadcast in 2014, ahead of the Scottish Referendum and was nominated for a Celtic Media Award in the Best Documentary category. The second, "[Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Rock](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vh0c8)" was broadcast in 2015 and continues to cost me a fortune in records. Both shows are still available on the BBC Radio 4 website.

## Sunday Morning Show - BBC Radio Wales

I present a regular Sunday morning show on BBC Radio Wales (as well as other bits and bobs when people are away). A link to the last few editions of the show, plus some best-bits, are available on the [my BBC Radio iPlayer page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wt6xy).

There are more best bits from the Sunday Show, various Saturday Shows and my "Twisted 2014" look back at the year on this Audioboom playlist.

## The Now Show - BBC Radio 4

I have written for The Now Show regularly since 2010 and appeared on the show itself three times.

## The News Quiz - BBC Radio 4

Having written gags for The News Quiz since 2009, I got to make this montage for the end of Sandi Toksvig's final show. There are certainly worse ways to spend a day than listening to 9 years of News Quizzes. And then, once I was finished, I put all the master tapes in the wrong boxes to really screw things up for the next person who tries.

## Gareth Gwynn's Twisted History Of BBC Wales - BBC Radio Wales

In 2014, BBC Wales Television celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. To celebrate, I made a programme about 90 years of radio, and the BBC were too polite to ask for the money back. These are some of the best-bits.

## The XFM Breakfast Show With Jon Holmes - XFM London

From 2013-15 I devised features and contributed topical gags, fake news stories, one-liners and sketches to this daily breakfast show. Podcasts and best bits [can be found here](https://audioboom.com/channel/xfmbreakfastshow).

## Passing On - BBC Radio Wales

A short behind the scenes video about this sitcom series I wrote starring Keiron Self, Richard Ellis, Melangell Dolma, Katy Wix and Felicity Montagu and produced by Benjamin Partridge for BBC Radio Wales.

<iframe width="400" height="500" frameborder="0" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p022yzh9/player"></iframe>

An article about the show was printed in the [Western Mail](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/gareth-gwynn-bbc-radio-wales-7427047).

## Pantheon Of Heroes - BBC Radio Wales

With Elis James and Benjamin Partridge, I devised and co-wrote this sketch show for BBC Radio Wales about Welsh history starring Elis, Ben and Nadia Kamil. It sometimes crops up on BBC Radio 4 Extra and there are some clips here featuring Nadia Kamil as Bonnie Tyler, giving Eurovision a second go (music by Rhodri Viney) and a fact round-up of Wales' 1958 Football World Cup campaign:

## The Roop And Tom Breakfast Show - XFM South Wales

Highlights from XFM South Wales' Breakfast Show...

Prior to their unsuccessful attempt at the world record for the fastest human wheelbarrow (100m), I oversaw Roop and Tom's demanding training regime:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P47WMzW_NI8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Another failed world record attempt. This time, the number of eggs held in a single human hand.
I'm afraid that this time round, the failure was partly my fault...
