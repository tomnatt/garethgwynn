# Podcasts & Videos

On this page, you'll find links to various radio shows, podcasts and videos
I've worked on over the last year or so. I'll use the blog on the front page 
to flag up anything that might appear on iPlayer, but these are links to bits 
and bobs that won't expire after only 7 days!

## Sunday Morning Show . BBC Radio Wales

I present a regular Sunday morning show on BBC Radio Wales. A
link to the latest edition on iPlayer is available from the show's
page on the [Radio Wales website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wt6xy).

## B.A.D. Radio - GWR Bath

A sketch show written and performed by Roop Jones, Tom Bowker and Gareth Gwynn. Two 
shows were made, which have each been split into 2 parts and are now all 
[up on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=133C3BA4BD0CFFA4).

## The Roop And Tom Breakfast Show - XFM South Wales

Highlights from XFM South Wales' Breakfast Show...

Prior to their unsuccessful attempt at the world record for the fastest human wheelbarrow (100m), 
I oversaw Roop and Tom's demanding training regime:

Another failed world record attempt. This time, the number of eggs held in a single human hand. 
I'm afraid that this time round, the failure was partly my fault...

There were also five Roop And Tom Breakfast Show podcasts, all of which are still available here:
