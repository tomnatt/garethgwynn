[Tourist Trap](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b0bmfpy5/tourist-trap) was a semi-improvised sitcom for BBC One Wales - I co-wrote the show's plots with Tudur Owen and Sian Harries and also provided the voice over. A collection of [clips](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmfpy5/clips) are available on the show's webpage and an interview detailing the writing process is available on the [BCG website](https://www.comedy.co.uk/pro/inside_track/how_we_write_tourist_trap/).

### Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive
[Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000240n) was the first Archive On Four to look, not backwards, but sideways - as we listened-in to radio stations from alternative universes and other dimensions.

### Just A Minute: 50 Years In 28 Minutes
I produced this show for BBC Radio 4 to celebrate 50 years of Just A Minute, cutting together archive episodes and creating exchanges between panellists that could never have happened in real life.

### The Gareth Gwynn Show
I was a regular presenter on BBC Radio Wales for seven years and a handful of best-bits can be found on the [BBC Radio Wales show page](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wt6xy/clips)

## Documentaries
I have presented several documentaries for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Wales examining Welsh identity, language, culture and politics - some of which are still available on BBC Sounds.<br>
* [Gareth Gwynn Declares Independence From Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000q4dj) <!--is a two-part investigation into why towns try and declare independence, what they mean by it - and what it would really take to achieve international recognition.--><br>
* [The Greatest Ever Faker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072j3fy) <!--told the story of Iolo Morganwg and was selected for the Prix Marulic International Radio Festival in Croatia, which meant it was played inside a deconsecrated church in Croatia. Or it wasn't. That's the problem with making a programme about forgery. I don't trust anything any more, [Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Rock](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001gdwp) (2015) continues to cost me a fortune in records and --><br>
* [Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Independence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vh0c8) <!--was broadcast ahead of the Scottish Referendum and was nominated for a Celtic Media Award in the Best Documentary category.-->
<!--The following video, featuring clips of the show, was made to promote [Harry Secombe - Unsung Comedian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000z7bg) (2021).<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This month marks 100 years since the birth of Welsh legend <br>Sir Harry Secombe.<br><br>This is a tribute to his vital role in the creation and success of<br>The Goon Show. <br><br>Including some fantastic images from <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCArchive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BBCArchive</a>...<br><br> Harry Secombe: Unsung Comedian <br>ðŸŽ§ Available now <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCSounds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BBCSounds</a> <a href="https://t.co/KdWhzDKjg6">pic.twitter.com/KdWhzDKjg6</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio Wales (@BBCRadioWales) <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCRadioWales/status/1436022742600585218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>-->

## Podcasts
### I'm So Not Over It
[I'm So Not Over It](https://play.acast.com/s/the-xennial-dome) is a podcast presented by Esyllt Sears and I covering history from 1977 to the present day - with episodes covering this month in history as well as series of interview episodes - all on the same feed. It used to be known as The Xennial Dome, when you could also get in touch via [MySpace](https://myspace.com/thexennialdome), but we didn't manage to prompt a comeback.
