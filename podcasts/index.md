### The Gareth Gwynn Show
I was a regular presenter on BBC Radio Wales for seven years and a handful of best-bits can be found on the [BBC Radio Wales show page](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wt6xy/clips)

### Documentaries
I have presented and produced several documentaries for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Wales on a variety of subjects, some of which are still available on BBC Sounds.<br>
* [Gareth Gwynn Hasn't Fin-](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001z5x1)
* [Rik Mayall, Panglobal Phenomenon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001zv68) 
* [Gareth Gwynn Declares Independence From Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000q4dj) <!--is a two-part investigation into why towns try and declare independence, what they mean by it - and what it would really take to achieve international recognition.--><br>
* [The Greatest Ever Faker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072j3fy) <!--told the story of Iolo Morganwg and was selected for the Prix Marulic International Radio Festival in Croatia, which meant it was played inside a deconsecrated church in Croatia. Or it wasn't. That's the problem with making a programme about forgery. I don't trust anything any more, [Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Rock](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001gdwp) (2015) continues to cost me a fortune in records and --><br>

<!--## Podcasts-->
### I'm So Not Over It
[I'm So Not Over It](https://play.acast.com/s/the-xennial-dome) is a podcast presented by Esyllt Sears and I covering history from 1977 to the present day - with episodes covering this month in history as well as series of interview episodes - all on the same feed. It used to be known as The Xennial Dome, when you could also get in touch via [MySpace](https://myspace.com/thexennialdome), but we didn't manage to prompt a comeback.
