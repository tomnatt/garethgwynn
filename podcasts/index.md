# Watch/Listen

On this page, you'll find links to some of the shows I have appeared in or worked on that won't expire after 30 days. Hopefully. Skip to [Sitcoms](#sitcoms), [Archive Shows](#archive-shows), [Documentaries](#documentaries) or [Podcasts](#podcasts).

## Sitcoms

## Archive Shows

### The Now Show - BBC Radio 4 (2011-2021)

My most recent appearence on The Now Show, using BBC archive to examine the relationship between the UK and France, is still available as part of the [Friday Night Comedy Podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0b3wp3q).

Audio from my first three appearences are on this [Audioboom playlist](https://audioboom.com/playlists/1291123-gareth-gwynn-on-the-now-show) and the fourth co-incided with the 50th Anniversary of BBC Local Radio.

### Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive - BBC Radio 4 (2019)

Kicking-off with an [actual scientist](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/darren.price.html) explaining the Many Worlds theory, [Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000240n) was the first Archive On Four to look, not backwards, but sideways - as we listened-in to radio stations from alternative universes and other dimensions.

It's an hour, which is quite long - but there are 113 other voices in it - so I'm pretty well diluted.

### Just A Minute: 50 Years In 28 Minutes - BBC Radio 4 (2017)

I produced this show for BBC Radio 4 to celebrate 50 years of Just A Minute, cutting together archive episodes and creating exchanges between panellists that could never have happened in real life.

### The Gareth Gwynn Show - BBC Radio Wales (2010-2017)

I was a regular presenter on BBC Radio Wales for seven years. A handful of best-bits can be found on the [BBC Radio Wales show page](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wt6xy/clips)

## Podcasts

### The Xennial Dome (2021-22)

## Documentaries

I have presented several documentaries for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Wales examining Welsh identity, language, culture and politics, many of which are still available on BBC Sounds.

[Gareth Gwynn Declares Independence From Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000q4dj) (2020) <!--is a two-part investigation into why towns try and declare independence, what they mean by it - and what it would really take to achieve international recognition.-->, [The Greatest Ever Faker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072j3fy) (2016) <!--told the story of Iolo Morganwg and was selected for the Prix Marulic International Radio Festival in Croatia, which meant it was played inside a deconsecrated church in Croatia. Or it wasn't. That's the problem with making a programme about forgery. I don't trust anything any more, [Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Rock](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001gdwp) (2015) continues to cost me a fortune in records.--> and [Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Independence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vh0c8) (2014). <!--was broadcast ahead of the Scottish Referendum and was nominated for a Celtic Media Award in the Best Documentary category.-->

<!--The following video, featuring clips of the show, was made to promote [Harry Secombe - Unsung Comedian](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000z7bg) (2021).
