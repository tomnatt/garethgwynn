# Podcasts & Videos

On this page, you'll find some of the radio shows, TV shows and podcasts I have appeared in or worked on that won't expire after 30 days. Hopefully.

## Ankle Tag - BBC Radio 4

[Ankle Tag](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092sfnk/episodes/guide) is a sitcom on BBC Radio 4 which I co-write with Benjamin Partridge and stars Elis James, Katy Wix and Steve Speirs. All three series are currently available on [BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092sfnk/episodes/guide).

## Tourist Trap - BBC One Wales

[Tourist Trap](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b0bmfpy5/tourist-trap) is a semi-improvised sitcom in which I supply the voice over as well as co-write the plots with Tudur Owen and Sian Harries. All thirteen episodes are currently available as a [Box Set](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b0bmfpy5/tourist-trap) and a collection of [clips](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmfpy5/clips) are available on the show's webpage.

## Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive - BBC Radio 4

Kicking-off with an [actual scientist](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/darren.price.html) explaining the Many Worlds theory, [Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000240n) was the first Archive On Four to look, not backwards, but sideways - as we listened-in to radio stations from alternative universes and other dimensions.

It's an hour, which is quite long - but there are 113 other voices in it - so I'm pretty well diluted.

## Documentaries - BBC Radio 4

I have presented three documentaries for BBC Radio 4 examining Welsh identity, language, culture and politics, all of which are still available on the BBC Radio 4 website.

"[Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Independence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vh0c8)" was broadcast in 2014, ahead of the Scottish Referendum and was nominated for a Celtic Media Award in the Best Documentary category.

"[Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Rock](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b055g69f)" was broadcast in 2015 and continues to cost me a fortune in records. 

"[The Greatest Ever Faker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072j3fy)" told the story of Iolo Morganwg and was selected for the Prix Marulic International Radio Festival in Croatia, which meant it was played inside a deconsecrated church in Croatia. Or it wasn't. That's the problem with making a programme about forgery. I don't trust anything any more.

## The Now Show - BBC Radio 4

I have appeared on The Now Show five times times. The fourth co-incided with the 50th Anniversary of BBC Local Radio...

## Just A Minute: 50 Years In 28 Minutes - BBC Radio 4

I produced this show for BBC Radio 4 to celebrate 50 years of Just A Minute, cutting together archive episodes and creating exchanges between panellists that could never have happened in real life.

## The Beef And Dairy Network - Podcast

I appeared on episodes [23](http://www.beefanddairynetwork.com/post/160921529730/episode-23-75th-anniversary-special) and [41](http://www.beefanddairynetwork.com/post/180262291995/episode-41-beefy-boy) of Benjamin Partridge's bovine-centric comedy podcast, The Beef And Dairy Network, as archivist Alex Neon. Around the time of my second appearence, I'd been working on quite a few archive shows and Ben interviewed me on the subject but asked me to change the words "BBC Radio Wales" for "Beef". Apart from that, it's all pretty accurate...

## Sue Perkins' Earpedia - Audible

Sue Perkins presents facts about animals, with assistance from Margaret Cabourn-Smith and Simon Kane, in this Audible Original series which I wrote with Gabby Hutchinson-Crouch, Jon Hunter.

John-Luke Roberts and I created and wrote this sitcom for Gold starring Robert Lindsay, Maureen Lipman, Naz Osmanoglu and Claudia Jessie. Here's a playlist which includes the trailer, a behind the scenes feature and some best-bits.
