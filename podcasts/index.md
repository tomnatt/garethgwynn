# Watch/Listen

On this page, you'll find links to some of the shows I have appeared in or worked on that won't expire after 30 days. Hopefully.

## Ankle Tag - BBC Radio 4 (2015-2020)

[Ankle Tag](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092sfnk/episodes/guide) is a sitcom on BBC Radio 4 which I co-write with Benjamin Partridge and stars Elis James, Katy Wix and Steve Speirs. All three series are currently available on [BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b092sfnk/episodes/guide).

## Tourist Trap - BBC One Wales (2018-2020)

[Tourist Trap](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b0bmfpy5/tourist-trap) is a semi-improvised sitcom in which I supply the voice over as well as co-write the plots with Tudur Owen and Sian Harries. All thirteen episodes are currently available as a [Box Set](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b0bmfpy5/tourist-trap) and a collection of [clips](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmfpy5/clips) are available on the show's webpage.

## The Goodies: The Big Ben Theory - Audible (2019)

A brand new audio episode of [The Goodies](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Goodies-Audiobook/B07YN6FSV2), written by John-Luke Roberts and me - with Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie and based on a plot by Barnaby Eaton-Jones.

## Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive - BBC Radio 4 (2019)

Kicking-off with an [actual scientist](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/darren.price.html) explaining the Many Worlds theory, [Gareth Gwynn's Alternative Archive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000240n) was the first Archive On Four to look, not backwards, but sideways - as we listened-in to radio stations from alternative universes and other dimensions.

It's an hour, which is quite long - but there are 113 other voices in it - so I'm pretty well diluted.

## The Now Show - BBC Radio 4 (2011-2019)

I have appeared on The Now Show five times times. Audio from my first three appearences are on this [Audioboom playlist](https://audioboom.com/playlists/1291123-gareth-gwynn-on-the-now-show) and the fourth co-incided with the 50th Anniversary of BBC Local Radio...

## Just A Minute: 50 Years In 28 Minutes - BBC Radio 4 (2017)

I produced this show for BBC Radio 4 to celebrate 50 years of Just A Minute, cutting together archive episodes and creating exchanges between panellists that could never have happened in real life.

## The Gareth Gwynn Show - BBC Radio Wales (2010-2017)

I was a regular presenter on BBC Radio Wales for seven years. A handful of best-bits can be found on the [BBC Radio Wales show page](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wt6xy/clips) 

## Documentaries - BBC Radio 4 (2014-2016)

I have presented three documentaries for BBC Radio 4 examining Welsh identity, language, culture and politics, all of which are still available on the BBC Radio 4 website.

"[Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Independence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vh0c8)" was broadcast in 2014, ahead of the Scottish Referendum and was nominated for a Celtic Media Award in the Best Documentary category.

"[Gareth Gwynn's Little Book Of Welsh Rock](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b055g69f)" was broadcast in 2015 and continues to cost me a fortune in records. 

"[The Greatest Ever Faker](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072j3fy)" told the story of Iolo Morganwg and was selected for the Prix Marulic International Radio Festival in Croatia, which meant it was played inside a deconsecrated church in Croatia. Or it wasn't. That's the problem with making a programme about forgery. I don't trust anything any more.

## Sue Perkins' Earpedia - Audible (2016-18)

Sue Perkins presents facts about animals, with assistance from Margaret Cabourn-Smith and Simon Kane, in this Audible Original series which I wrote with Gabby Hutchinson-Crouch and Jon Hunter.

Sue Perkins' Earpedia Series 1: [Animals](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/Sue-Perkins-Earpedia-Animals-Audiobook/B0779GZQQ1?ref=a_a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=c6e316b8-14da-418d-8f91-b3cad83c5183&pf_rd_r=XYJ5TGRXXZS4NKX171YT&) 

Sue Perkins' Earpedia Series 2: [Plants](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Non-fiction/Sue-Perkins-Earpedia-Plants-Audiobook/B07CTRGBQB?ref=a_pd_Non-fi_c14_moreAuthors_0&pf_rd_p=e451f83d-9b5c-40e4-bc18-48e770df7327&pf_rd_r=TXGVQ9TZYK46B2EXE343&)

## Bull - Gold (2015)

John-Luke Roberts and I created and wrote this sitcom for Gold starring Robert Lindsay, Maureen Lipman, Naz Osmanoglu and Claudia Jessie. Here's a playlist which includes the trailer, a behind the scenes feature and some best-bits.
