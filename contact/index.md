# Contact Gareth

Gareth Gwynn is represented by Kate Haldane at PBJ Management - for any enquires, please email [kateh@pbjmanagement.co.uk](mailto:kateh@pbjmanagement.co.uk).

Gareth also appears on his [own little bit of the PBJ website](https://www.pbjmanagement.co.uk/artists/gareth-gwynn).

You can still contact Gareth directly on the unwieldly [ihaveseenthedoorknob@googlemail.com](mailto:ihaveseenthedoorknob@googlemail.com), although for any comments about the website, its programming and all that sort of technical stuff, you're are best going to [garethssite@tomnatt.com](mailto:garethssite@tomnatt.com).
