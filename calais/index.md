# Why DID he go to Calais?

Here we commemorate in pictorial form the time Gareth and Tom made a trip to Calais from Edinburgh, and all for no reason other than the comedian Mark Watson hinted it might be funny. They left around 3pm, 3 hours into the 36 hour show, and returned 10pm the following day. Those 31 hours were to be long and arduous as they did battle with French customs, British railways, and The Terror and these pictures chronicle the trip in an appallingly vague manner.

Some more training later, and we found our Driver (Ed, left) and his Misses (Lara, right) who would speed us to France</p>

This was written on the side of a Polish lorry. It's amazing what some people will haul around.</p>

The environmental cost for this kind of trip is high</p>

And keeps getting higher. Won't somebody think of the children?</p>

Goodbye England. I do hope my GCSE French is up to the task...</p>

England vanishing into the morning mist. It's all quite poetic really.</p>

Poetic or not, we're on a boat and there really is only one place to go next...</p>

Calais is even more unpleasant than Dover. In all our time, this was the nicest building we could find (the church that is, not the shed).</p>

More delightful images of Calais. If you look closely, you can see the bemused look on the drivers face.</p>

38 minutes in France, a conversation with a frenchman (in French!) and the sausage-lental-experience as proof!</p>

We were going to bring this back for you all, but thought it might be considered a dangerous weapon during The Terror...</p>
